# MuFBDTester
Function block diagram (FBD) is a standard programming language for programmable logic controllers (PLCs). As PLCs have been commonly used to develop safety-critical systems, it is crucial to test FBD programs for such systems effectively. Research on automated FBD test generation mainly focused on achieving certain structural coverage criteria. Although tests achieving a high coverage level can detect errors, they fail to provide the assurance of fault detection. Mutation testing is an error-based testing technique that can be used to generate mutation-adequate test suite. Mutation-adequate test suites are highly effective at revealing specific types of faults that are expressed by mutation operators. Since FBD programs are mainly implemented in safety-critical systems, it is required to provide some guarantees for fault detection. To provide a certain level of guarantee for detecting specific types of faults, this project MuFBDTester developed an automated testing tool that generates mutation-based test sequence for FBD programs.
